# ProjectFlow App - Feature Requirements
*Based on User Manual Analysis*

## Core App Architecture

### 1. Dual Board System
**Discovery Board**
- Columns: Opportunities → Hypotheses → In Test → Learning → Archive
- Custom fields: OKR link, problem statement, target metric, success criteria, evidence URL, confidence level (1-10), effort estimate (S/M/L)
- Automated experiment timers
- WIP limit enforcement

**Delivery Board**
- Columns: Ready → In Progress → Review → Released → Measuring
- WIP limits: In Progress (3), Review (2)
- Definition of Ready/Done policies
- Automatic measurement task creation

### 2. OKR Management System
