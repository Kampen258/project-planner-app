## ‚ùå Missing New Agile Features

### 1. **Dual Board System** - MISSING
**Required:** Discovery Track + Delivery Track boards
**Current:** Single project/task view
**Gap:** Need separate board interfaces for:
- Discovery: Opportunities ‚Üí Hypotheses ‚Üí In Test ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Archive
- Delivery: Ready ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Released ‚Üí Measuring

### 2. **OKR Management System** - MISSING
**Required:** Objectives & Key Results tracking
**Current:** Basic project goals
**Gap:** Need complete OKR system with:
- Objectives creation and linking
- Key Results with baseline ‚Üí target metrics
- Progress visualization dashboards
- Quarterly review cycles

### 3. **Discovery Track Features** - MISSING
**Current:** Traditional project planning
**Gap:** Need complete discovery methodology:
- Opportunity management (problem statements, scoring)
- Hypothesis creation with structured templates
- Experiment tracking with timers and results
- Evidence linking (analytics, research, support tickets)

### 4. **Flow Metrics & Analytics** - MISSING
**Required:** Comprehensive flow tracking
**Current:** Basic project progress
**Gap:** Need advanced metrics:
- Cycle time, lead time, throughput
- WIP limits and enforcement
- Aging work alerts
- Flow bottleneck identification

### 5. **Decision Log System** - MISSING
**Required:** Structured decision tracking
**Current:** No decision documentation
**Gap:** Complete decision log with rationale, evidence, outcomes

### 6. **Templates System** - MISSING
**Required:** Opportunity, Hypothesis, Decision templates
**Current:** Basic project templates
**Gap:** Structured templates for New Agile methodology

### 7. **Automation Features** - MISSING
**Required:** Flow automation and alerts
**Current:** Manual processes
**Gap:** Need automated:
- Experiment timers
- WIP limit enforcement
- Measurement reminders
- Aging item alerts

### 8. **Advanced Role Management** - PARTIAL
**Current:** Basic user/team structure
**Gap:** Need specific New Agile roles:
- Product Lead (OKR ownership)
- Discovery Owner (experiment management)
- Delivery Owner (flow health)
- Team Members (pull-based work)

## üìä Implementation Priority Matrix

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**High Impact, Medium Effort**
1. Add OKR management system
2. Create dual board basic structure
3. Enhance existing projects to support discovery/delivery split

### Phase 2: Discovery Track (Weeks 3-4)
**High Impact, High Effort**
1. Opportunity management system
2. Hypothesis creation and tracking
3. Experiment management with timers
4. Evidence linking system

### Phase 3: Flow & Metrics (Weeks 5-6)
**Medium Impact, High Effort**
1. Flow metrics calculation engine
2. WIP limits and enforcement
3. Advanced dashboards and reporting
4. Automated alerts and notifications

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)
**Medium Impact, Medium Effort**
1. Decision log system
2. Template system
3. Advanced role management
4. Integration enhancements

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema Additions Needed

### New Tables Required:
```sql
-- OKRs Management
objectives (id, title, description, quarter, year, owner_id)
key_results (id, objective_id, title, baseline, target, current, unit)

-- Discovery Track
opportunities (id, problem_statement, evidence_url, impact_estimate, confidence_score, effort_estimate)
hypotheses (id, opportunity_id, hypothesis_statement, success_criteria, test_method)
experiments (id, hypothesis_id, start_date, end_date, status, results)
insights (id, experiment_id, learning, evidence, next_steps)

-- Decision Log
decisions (id, title, context, options_considered, rationale, owner_id, review_date)

-- Flow Metrics
work_items (id, board_type, column, entered_at, wip_position)
flow_events (id, item_id, event_type, timestamp, metadata)
```

### Existing Tables to Enhance:
```sql
-- Add to projects table
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN objective_id UUID REFERENCES objectives(id);
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN board_type VARCHAR CHECK (board_type IN ('discovery', 'delivery'));

-- Add to tasks table
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN experiment_id UUID REFERENCES experiments(id);
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN definition_of_ready JSONB;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN definition_of_done JSONB;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN wip_limit INTEGER;
```

## üöÄ Quick Wins (Can implement immediately)

1. **Copy user manual and requirements docs to project folder**
2. **Add OKR basic structure to existing project model**
3. **Create separate board views for existing projects**
4. **Add flow status columns to task management**
5. **Enhance project creation to include OKR linking**

## üéØ Success Metrics for Implementation

**Phase 1 Success:**
- Can create projects with linked OKRs
- Dual board view displays correctly
- Basic flow tracking works

**Phase 2 Success:**
- Can create and track experiments
- Hypothesis templates working
- Evidence can be linked to opportunities

**Phase 3 Success:**
- Flow metrics calculating correctly
- WIP limits enforcing
- Dashboards showing real-time data

**Phase 4 Success:**
- Full New Agile workflow operational
- All user manual features implemented
- Team can operate per methodology

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Copy documentation to app folder**
2. **Start with OKR system implementation**
3. **Enhance existing project structure gradually**
4. **Build discovery track on top of current foundation**
5. **Add flow metrics as final layer**

Your existing app provides an excellent foundation - we can build the New Agile methodology on top of your current structure rather than starting from scratch.
